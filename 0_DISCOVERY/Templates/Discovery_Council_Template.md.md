**Codex OS v1.3 — Vision Council / Phase 0 Diagnostic Framework**

---

## 1. Overview

The **Discovery Council** (formerly “Vision Council”) is the optional pre-phase (Phase 0) of Codex OS.  
It activates when a client or project requires **deep philosophical alignment**, **strategic diagnosis**, or **identity reconstruction** before formal systemization.

This process brings together:
- The **Human Router** (you)
- The three Codex intelligences (!GPT, !CLA, !GEM)
- Optionally, client input or transcript excerpts

The goal is to reveal **who the client is**, **what they could become**, and **where tension or opportunity lies** before entering Foundation.

| **Router** | Lead human operator | Jor Ferraro |
| **Codex Version** | System version in use | v1.3 |
| **Status** | `active` / `archived` | active |
| **Session Type** | `initial_diagnostic` / `update` / `revisit` | initial_diagnostic |

## 3. Inputs (Raw Material)

### 3.1. Human Notes
> Paste or summarize all relevant meeting notes, transcripts, and spontaneous observations.  
> Include emotional tone, body language cues, contradictions, or key phrases.


Example:

“She values truth over visibility.”

“Feels misaligned with current digital presence.”

“High intuition, but lacks systemized clarity.”


### 3.2. Client Artifacts
List any existing materials reviewed:
- Website / Social profiles  
- Press articles  
- Brand deck / Pitch docs  
- Content archives  

Format:  

[Link or File Reference] — [1-line summary of relevance]

## 4. Layer Contributions

Each intelligence contributes independently, following the SYNC & ROUTE protocol.

---

### 4.1. !GPT — Architect Layer  
**Focus:** Structural logic, brand DNA, system potential.

**Prompts:**
- What does this client *fundamentally* represent as a system?
- What structural or philosophical inconsistencies are visible?
- What could be codified as the brand’s underlying architecture?

**Output Fields:**
- Foundational Hypothesis  
- Potential Archetype  
- Systemic Weak Points  
- Strategic Leverage Points  

---

### 4.2. !CLA — Poet Layer  
**Focus:** Narrative truth, emotional coherence, symbolic alignment.

**Prompts:**
- What is emotionally true about this client?
- Where does the brand’s tone feel dissonant or performative?
- What story is waiting to be told — but hasn’t been?

**Output Fields:**
- Emotional Axis  
- Narrative Tension  
- Voice & Authenticity Score (0–1)  
- Symbolic Anchors  

---

### 4.3. !GEM — Analyst Layer  
**Focus:** Contextual and market intelligence, opportunity and risk.

**Prompts:**
- What macro or micro trends intersect with this client’s domain?
- What market whitespace or differentiation gap is visible?
- What risks (brand, structural, competitive) require attention?

**Output Fields:**
- Market Context Summary  
- Competitor Snapshot  
- Opportunity Index (0–100)  
- Strategic Risks

## 5. Cross-Synthesis (Router Summary)

After receiving individual AI responses, the Human Router consolidates all insights.

| Element | Summary |
|----------|----------|
| **Unifying Thread** | Core pattern that connects all three perspectives |
| **Contradictions** | Areas where AIs disagree or show tension |
| **Emergent Themes** | Recurring ideas or symbolic motifs |
| **Provisional Direction** | Early hypothesis for Foundation layer |

---

## 6. Next Steps

| Step | Responsible | Output | Deadline |
|------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **Finalize Discovery Summary** | Router | `Discovery_Summary.md` | +48h |
| **Activate Foundation Layer** | !GPT | `Brand_Architect_Blueprint.md` | After summary |
| **Optional: AI Follow-Up Sync** | !CLA, !GEM | Clarification pass | If required |

---

## 7. Metadata Schema (for automation)

When integrated with Notion, Sheets, or n8n, use this schema for automated logging:

``` json
{
  "module_id": "CDX_Discovery_001",
  "parent_phase": "Discovery",
  "client": "Sandra Borghi",
  "status": "active",
  "learning_link": "Foundation",
  "created_at": "2025-10-27T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": null
}

``` 
## **8. Example Output Summary**


Client: Sandra Borghi
System Insight (!GPT): Fragmented brand architecture, strong human truth potential.
Emotional Insight (!CLA): Voice authentic but inconsistent — needs tonal coherence.
Analytical Insight (!GEM): Market differentiation gap in emotional journalism.
Router Synthesis: System will focus on truth-as-luxury and coherence-through-ritual.
Next Step: Build Brand_Architect_Blueprint.md with this philosophical DNA.
