**Codex OS v1.3 â€” Architecture Dependencies Map**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines all **functional dependencies** between the Codex OS modules and layers.  
It describes how information, control, and feedback flow between components, ensuring full **traceability**, **replicability**, and **fault isolation**.

Each module connects logically through **data**, **context**, and **learning** relationships, governed by the system constants and SYNC protocols.

---

## 2. Dependency Overview

Codex OS is organized into **five primary layers** plus two meta-structures:


Discovery â†’ Foundation â†’ Awareness â†’ Creation â†’ Reflection

â†˜â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†–

(Echo Layer)

(_SYSTEM Infrastructure)


| Layer | Description | Depends On | Feeds Into |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 0. Discovery | Captures human vision, goals, and client context. | â€” | Foundation |
| 1. Foundation | Defines brand DNA, principles, and operational blueprint. | Discovery | Awareness, Creation |
| 2. Awareness | Gathers external intelligence (platforms, trends, audience). | Foundation | Creation |
| 3. Creation | Generates and deploys content and campaigns. | Foundation + Awareness | Reflection |
| 4. Reflection | Measures performance and generates learning signals. | Creation | Foundation (via Echo Layer) |
| âˆž. Echo Layer | Processes cross-layer learning and updates constants. | All layers | All layers |
| _SYSTEM | Maintains constants, prompts, protocols, and version control. | All layers | All layers |

## 3. Module Dependency Map

### **0. DISCOVERY**
**Dependencies:**
- None (entry point).
- Relies on human intelligence and qualitative data input.

**Provides:**
- `Discovery_Session.md`
- `Client_Profile.json`
- `Strategic_Objectives.md`

**Feeds:**  
â†’ Foundation layer (Philosophical Genome and Operating Blueprints)

---

### **1. FOUNDATION**
**Dependencies:**
- Receives client intent and vision from Discovery.  
- Requires `_SYSTEM/Constants/Echo_Constants_v1.0.json` for global parameters.

**Provides:**
- `Philosophical_Genome/`  
- `Core_Principles.md`  
- `Operating_Blueprints/`  

**Feeds:**  
â†’ Awareness layer (for contextual alignment)  
â†’ Creation layer (for voice and strategic direction)

**Critical Dependency:**  
Maintains the **Codex Manifesto** â€” defines tone, truth, and purpose across all operations.

---

### **2. AWARENESS**
**Dependencies:**
- Requires philosophical and operational constants from Foundation.
- Pulls parameters from Echo Constants (for trending metrics and calibration).

**Provides:**
- `Cultural_Radar.md`  
- `Platform_Intelligence/` (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn)  
- `Competitive_Analysis_Template.md`

**Feeds:**  
â†’ Creation layer (context for execution decisions)

**Critical Dependency:**  
Interacts dynamically with Echo Layer to adapt to algorithmic shifts and user behavior.

---

### **3. CREATION**
**Dependencies:**
- Depends on Awareness (external data) and Foundation (internal DNA).
- Requires templates from `_SYSTEM/Prompts/` for Post Briefs.
- Syncs periodically with Echo Constants for learning updates.

**Provides:**
- `Job_Packets/`
- `Content_Queue/`
- `Post_Brief_Generator_v2.1.md`

**Feeds:**  
â†’ Reflection layer for performance analysis.

**Critical Dependency:**  
All creative decisions must reference `taste_profile_target` and `caption_length_bin` to ensure traceability within Echo Reports.

---

### **4. REFLECTION**
**Dependencies:**
- Relies on Creation output data (`metrics`, `captions`, `saves`, `shares`, etc.).
- Reads constants from Echo Constants file.
- Integrates analysis protocols from `_SYSTEM/Protocols/`.

**Provides:**
- `EchoReports/`  
- `Calibration_Reports/`  
- `Momentum_Index/`

**Feeds:**  
â†’ Echo Layer (for automated learning)
â†’ Foundation (for updated tone and strategic recalibration)

**Critical Dependency:**  
Reflection is the **learning engine**; without it, Codex OS ceases to evolve.

---

### **âˆž. ECHO LAYER (Transversal)**
**Dependencies:**
- Consumes input from all layers simultaneously.
- Requires access to:
  - `_SYSTEM/Constants/Echo_Constants_v1.0.json`
  - `EchoReport_Schema_v2.0.json`
  - `Calibration_Reports/`

**Provides:**
- Updated constants and insights
- Cross-phase calibration directives

**Feeds:**  
â†’ Foundation (values calibration)  
â†’ Creation (execution adjustments)

**Critical Dependency:**  
Operates autonomously using data thresholds and divergence detection.

---

### **_SYSTEM (Infrastructure)**
**Dependencies:**
- Relied upon by all layers.  
- Must exist before any other module can operate.

**Contains:**
- `/Constants/` â€” system-wide parameters  
- `/Prompts/` â€” initialization files for AIs  
- `/Protocols/` â€” communication standards  
- `/Version_Control/` â€” changelogs and version tracking  

**Feeds:**  
â†’ All layers (configuration, synchronization, reinitialization)

**Critical Dependency:**  
Acts as **Codex OS DNA** â€” if corrupted, use `Recovery_Checklist.md` to restore.

## 4. Cross-Layer Dependencies Summary

| From | To | Type | Description |
|------|----|------|-------------|
| Discovery | Foundation | Context | Translates human intent into brand structure |
| Foundation | Awareness | Logic | Provides philosophical and tonal base |
| Awareness | Creation | Data | Supplies real-time context and trends |
| Creation | Reflection | Metrics | Feeds performance data for learning |
| Reflection | Foundation + Creation | Learning | Recalibrates behavior and constants |
| Echo Layer | All | Feedback | Manages system-wide learning and recalibration |
| _SYSTEM | All | Infrastructure | Hosts constants, prompts, and communication logic |

## 5. AI Layer Dependencies

| AI | Function | Primary Dependencies | Produces | Interacts With |
|----|-----------|----------------------|-----------|----------------|
| !GPT | Architect | `_SYSTEM/Protocols/`, `Echo_Constants_v1.0.json` | Post_Briefs, Blueprints | !CLA, !GEM |
| !CLA | Poet | `Foundation`, `Awareness` | Taste Tags, Rhythm Notes | !GPT, !GEM |
| !GEM | Analyst | `Reflection`, `EchoReports` | Metrics, Calibration Reports | !GPT, !CLA |
| Jor | Router | All | Sync Commands, Approvals | All AIs |

---

## 6. Failure Dependency Points

| Risk Area | Impact | Preventive Action |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| Echo Constants corrupted | Incoherent learning feedback | Restore from backup or previous Echo Report |
| Foundation missing | Narrative inconsistency | Restore from Philosophical Genome |
| Awareness outdated | Irrelevant strategic decisions | Run update cycle weekly |
| Creation delay | Learning lag | Shorten post cycle to 72h |
| Reflection missing data | No feedback loop | Verify metrics pipeline weekly |
| _SYSTEM desync | Total failure | Run `Bootstrap_Protocol.md` |
