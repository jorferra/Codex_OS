# Calibration Protocol — Codex (CDX)

### PURPOSE  
Establish a human-centered process for adjusting Codex after each Echo cycle.

---

## 1️⃣ TRIGGERS
- Echo Reports with high divergence  
- New insights from human resonance notes  
- Platform or algorithmic changes detected by !GEM  

---

## 2️⃣ STEPS

| Step | Actor | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | !GEM | Flags anomalies and compiles summary. |
| 2 | !CLA | Interprets symbolic/emotional meaning. |
| 3 | Jor | Approves or rejects proposed changes. |
| 4 | !GPT | Updates constants, templates, or prompts. |
| 5 | System | Logs calibration into Changelog. |

---

## 3️⃣ CALIBRATION LEVELS
| Level | Type | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| L1 | Post-level | Minor adjustment (hook, tone, rhythm). |
| L2 | System-level | Medium adjustment (taste tags, ratios). |
| L3 | Philosophical | Major adjustment (brand tone, framework). |

---

## 4️⃣ HUMAN OVERRIDE
All calibrations require **Jor’s approval** before implementation.  
Codex nunca se recalibra solo.
