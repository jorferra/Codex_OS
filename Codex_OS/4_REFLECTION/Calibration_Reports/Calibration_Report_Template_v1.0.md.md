# ⚙️ Calibration Report Template — Codex OS  
**Layer:** 4 — Reflection  
**Version:** 1.1  
**Author:** CDX Router (Jor Ferraro)  
**Status:** Active  
**Visibility:** Internal

## 1. Purpose

The **Calibration Report** transforms insight into action.  
It takes the findings from the Echo Report and defines *what changes* the system must apply across tone, structure, rhythm, and operational patterns.

If the Echo Report is a mirror,  
the Calibration Report is the adjustment of the lens.

## 2. Triggers

| Trigger Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Automatic** | Triggered after a validated Echo Report with `"learning_transferred": true`. |
| **Manual** | Initiated by Router (Jor) after reviewing unexpected system behavior or major trend shift. |

Generated files are stored in:  
`/4_REFLECTION/Calibration_Reports/[YYYY-MM-DD]_Client_Calibration.md`

### 1️⃣ Source Summary (!GEM)

Extract key learnings from the most recent Echo Report.  

| Domain | Insight | Confidence | Impact Level |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Caption | Shorter metaphors improve comprehension. | 0.91 | High |
| Visuals | Natural light increases watch time. | 0.84 | Medium |
| Tone | Grounded reflection outperforms motivational phrasing. | 0.93 | High |
| Posting Time | Earlier weekday posts yield 12% higher reach. | 0.79 | Medium |

---

### 2️⃣ Systemic Adjustments (!GPT)

Defines what *Codex OS itself* should adjust for future runs.  

| Module | Adjustment | Description | Implementation Method |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Post_Brief_Generator | Modify caption_length_bin weighting. | Favor “medium” bins by +15%. | Update `Echo_Constants_v1.0.json` |
| Remix Engine | Prioritize reflective tone in Act II. | Refine pattern templates. | Adjust `Caption_Rhythm_Notes.md` |
| Awareness Layer | Boost observation window to 96h. | Capture long-tail engagement. | Update automation node in n8n |
| Momentum Index | Recalculate thresholds with +0.1 bias toward saves ratio. | Enhance retention calibration. | Update `Momentum_Index_Spec_v1.0.md` |

---

### 3️⃣ Narrative Recalibration (!CLA)

Defines how emotional and aesthetic tone will evolve.

> **Observation:** The calm content resonated, but it lacked micro-tension.  
> **Recalibration Directive:**  
> “Inject a subtle sense of movement — stillness that breathes, not stillness that freezes.”  

This directive becomes part of the next caption generation cycle.

---

### 4️⃣ Router Commentary (Jor)

Personal qualitative reflection — human taste layer.

> “It’s not about doing less. It’s about doing quieter —  
> but with intention so sharp it still cuts through the noise.”  

> “Next cycle: test formats where silence isn’t absence — it’s framing.”

---

### 5️⃣ System Update Log (!GPT)

All adjustments are logged automatically into `/12_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION/Version_Control/Current_Version.md`

Example:

[2025-11-03]

- Updated Echo_Constants_v1.0.json → v1.1
    
- Adjusted caption_length_bin weighting (+15% medium)
    
- Extended Momentum Index observation window (72h → 96h)
    
- Revised Remix Engine templates (Reflective cadence)

### 6️⃣ Recalibration Targets (!GEM)

Quantifiable KPIs for next learning loop.

| Target | Previous Value | New Goal | Evaluation Date |
|---------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| Engagement Rate | 8.7% | ≥9.5% | +30 days |
| Saves-to-Shares Ratio | 1.8 | ≥2.0 | +30 days |
| Caption Resonance Index | 0.82 | ≥0.87 | +30 days |
| Momentum Stability | 0.76 | ≥0.80 | +60 days |

## 4. Automation Hooks (n8n Integration)

| Node | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Echo Sync** | Pulls metrics from last Echo Report |
| **Updater** | Modifies constants (JSON schemas) |
| **Logger** | Appends adjustments to Version Control |
| **Router Notifier** | Sends Telegram or email summary |
| **Next Cycle Trigger** | Starts Post_Brief_Generator recalibration |

## **6. Operating Philosophy**

  

> The Echo hears.

> The Calibration learns.

> Together they ensure that Codex never repeats — it evolves.
