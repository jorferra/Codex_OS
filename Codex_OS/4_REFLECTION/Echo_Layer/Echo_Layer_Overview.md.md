# Echo Layer Overview — Codex (CDX) v1.3

### PURPOSE  
The Echo Layer is the self-learning mechanism of Codex.  
It transforms every piece of creative work into data, every data point into meaning,  
and every meaning into system calibration.

---

## 1️⃣ DEFINITION
The Echo Layer is **transversal** — it touches all phases:
```
Discovery → Foundation → Awareness → Creation → Reflection
```
It captures feedback, performance metrics, and human notes in real time.

---

## 2️⃣ CORE FUNCTIONS
| Function | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 📈 Data Capture | Collects metrics (reach, saves, shares, sentiment) from each post. |
| 🧩 Pattern Recognition | Detects divergences (`brilliant_misfire` / `hollow_hit`). |
| 🧠 Learning Loop | Updates constants and prompts dynamically. |
| 🪞 Human Reflection | Integrates Jor’s resonance notes into the system. |

---

## 3️⃣ ECHO OUTPUTS
| Output | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `EchoReport.json` | Quantitative | Metrics + Derived learning |
| `Calibration_Report.md` | Qualitative | Human–AI synthesis |
| `Divergence_Log.md` | Log | Tracks pattern anomalies |
| `Learning_Update.md` | Update | Adjusted system insights |

---

## 4️⃣ FEEDBACK SOURCES
- Platform metrics (IG, YT, TikTok, etc.)
- Qualitative annotations from !CLA and Jor
- System-calculated sincerity and momentum indexes

---

## 5️⃣ ROLE COORDINATION
- **!GEM:** generates Echo Reports and flags divergences.  
- **!CLA:** interprets divergences emotionally (taste + symbolic analysis).  
- **!GPT:** updates briefs and constants accordingly.  
- **Jor:** approves calibration and signs off adjustments.

---

## 6️⃣ FREQUENCY
- Every **post** triggers a micro-calibration.  
- Every **week** triggers a macro-calibration cycle (system-level updates).  

---

### PRINCIPLE  
> “Every output is a teacher.”  
Codex learns by acting, not by pausing.
