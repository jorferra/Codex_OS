## 1. Purpose

A **Job Packet** groups several Post_Briefs under one strategic objective.  
It represents a campaign, theme, or initiative designed to explore a larger hypothesis across multiple creative executions.

Where a **Post_Brief** is a *single action*,  
a **Job Packet** is a *strategic arc* — a full learning cycle.

---

## 2. Structure

Each Job Packet lives in its own directory:  
`/3_CREATION/Job_Packets/[YYYY-MM-DD]_[Client]_[Theme]/`

Example:

📁 2025-10-30_SandraBorghi_StillnessSeries/

├── Job_Packet.json

├── Briefs/

│   ├── CDX_BRIEF_SB_2025_10_30_001.json

│   ├── CDX_BRIEF_SB_2025_10_30_002.json

│   └── CDX_BRIEF_SB_2025_10_30_003.json

├── Strategy_Notes.md

└── Summary_Report.md

## **4. Lifecycle**


1️⃣ Define Theme → 2️⃣ Generate 3–5 Post_Briefs → 3️⃣ Publish Sequentially →  
4️⃣ Analyze via Echo Layer → 5️⃣ Produce Summary_Report → 6️⃣ Update Pattern Library


Each Job Packet closes with a **learning synthesis** recorded in /5_REFLECTION/Calibration_Reports/.


## **5. Roles & Responsibilities**


|**Role**|**Function**|**Deliverable**|
|---|---|---|
|!GPT|Architectures the campaign logic and defines hypothesis|Job_Packet.json|
|!CLA|Ensures emotional and aesthetic coherence across posts|Taste Sync + Tone Map|
|!GEM|Tracks performance metrics, resonance trends, and divergences|EchoReport.json|
|Router (Jor)|Oversees direction, pacing, and creative taste|Final Summary_Report.md|

## **6. Strategy Notes (Structure)**


Each **Strategy_Notes.md** should summarize:

## Overview
Objective, tone, and hypothesis behind the Job Packet.

## Key Message
Main conceptual thread uniting all posts.

## Emotional Tone Map (!CLA)
List of target taste_tags per post and emotional progression across campaign.

## Tactical Plan (!GPT)
Posting frequency, distribution, and hooks strategy.

## Observational Targets (!GEM)
Metrics or indicators to monitor (engagement, saves-to-likes ratio, audience comments).

## Router Notes (Jor)
Reflections, decisions, or unexpected insights during campaign execution.


## **7. Summary Report (Structure)**

  

After completion, the Router produces a **Summary_Report.md** that consolidates human and system learning.

## **8. Integration with n8n**


|**Node**|**Function**|
|---|---|
|**Trigger**|When a new Job_Packet.json is added|
|**Brief Loader**|Loads related Post_Briefs|
|**Scheduler**|Publishes each Post_Brief at defined intervals|
|**Echo Aggregator**|Collects all Echo Reports into Summary_Report|
|**Pattern Updater**|Sends learnings to Pattern Library and Awareness Layer|

## **9. Metadata**

## **10. Operating Philosophy**

  

> A Job Packet is not a campaign — it’s a laboratory.

> Each post is an experiment. Each iteration refines the system.

> Codex doesn’t just manage creative work — it learns through it.

**Next Recommended File:**

/4_REFLECTION/Echo_Report_Template.md — defines how system performance and resonance are measured and interpreted after Job Packet execution.
